<!-- Create the basic timer -->


HTML Structure:
Add a div element above the timer to contain the task list.
Inside the div, create a form element to hold the text areas and radio buttons.
Add an "Add Task" button to dynamically add more text areas for tasks.
Task Input:

When the page loads, retrieve any previously saved tasks from local storage.
Display the saved tasks in the text areas.
Allow the user to add or remove text areas using the "Add Task" button.
Task Selection:

At the start of a pomodoro session, display the tasks from the text areas as radio buttons.
Store the selected task in a variable.
Timer Completion:

When the timer ends, display a message or notification to indicate completion.
Enable the radio buttons corresponding to the available tasks.
Add a click event listener to the radio buttons.
Task Completion:

When a radio button is clicked, mark it as checked/selected.
Update the task status as "completed" in the local storage or an array.
Next Pomodoro Session:

Clear the timer completion message/notification.
Disable the completed radio buttons.
Display the remaining unchecked radio buttons as available tasks.
Store the selected task for the next pomodoro session.
Repeat the Process:

Continue the pomodoro sessions with updated task availability and selection.


Data Persistence:

Store the tasks and their completion status in local storage or an array.
Update the task status on completion to maintain progress between sessions.
